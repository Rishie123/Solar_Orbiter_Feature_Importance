This is a secondary repo for supporting a dashboard made after the analysis was done.

It isn't sensible to share the original analysis simply because, the data is large enough for it to become impossible to share here or on Google Drive.

I have put it on Github for the convenience of hosting a dashboard from it on a free server.
